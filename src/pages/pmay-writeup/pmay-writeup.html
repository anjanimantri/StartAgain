    <u>How to get the Home Loan Subsidy?</u> <br><br> 1. Apply for home loan with a Bank/Financial institution. <br> 2. If eligible
    for subsidy, your application will be forwarded to the Central Nodal Agency (CNA). <br> 3. If it's approved, the CNA
    will disburse the subsidy amount to the Banker/Financial instition. <br> 4. This will be credited to your Loan account,
    thus reducing the total loan amount. <br> 5. For instance, if your annual income is Rs 6 lakh and the loan amount is
    Rs 9 lakh, then subsidy will be upto 2.67 Lakhs. <br> 6. When this is deducted, the loan is reduced to 6.33 Lakhs. You
    will pay EMI on this lowered amount.
